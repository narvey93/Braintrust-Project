# Braintrust-Project

This is the script for the take-home assesment portion of the interview. I wrote a simple Python script that pulls event data for all experiments/datasets in the specified project and outputs them as CSVs into a single folder that could be uploaded for support to diagnose. The script requires the user to specify the Project ID that they want to pull data from as well as a valid API key that can be used for all necessary calls.
